Other than school, Iâ€™ve dipped my foot in many different waters exploring many different areas of interest. In my free time, I enjoy going outside biking, running and also bouldering. It helps me clear my mind when I feel overwelmed, being outdoor also expand my visions of the world and see it from different perspectives.\n\nlibrary(\"usethis\")"
